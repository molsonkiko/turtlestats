## [Unreleased] - yyyy-mm-dd
 
### To Be Added

- more ways of visualizing game stats
- maybe make it so that the scoreboard class is generated by turtlestats, rather than the user having to create their own?
 
### To Be Changed

### To Be Fixed
 
- broken stuff

## [0.4.0] - 2022-09-13

### Added

- Automated tests using [pyautogui](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/roadmap.html?highlight=window#roadmap) to automatically play a simple test game and populate a database.

### Changed

- If you write the plot to file using `display`, the matplotlib gui viewer no longer opens.

### Fixed

- The top_users `display` option now correctly limits the number of top users.

## [0.3.0] - 2022-09-12

### Changed

- Fix bug where there was no way to get out of choosing a directory in turtlestats.display if no `.turtlestats` directory exists by changing behavior so that `Cancel` quits the form. '.' can be used to get the current directory, after all.

## [0.2.0] - 2022-09-12

### Added

- Add [turtlestats.display](/README.md#command-line-usage), a CLI app that creates simple matplotlib plots based on the stats for a given game.
- Show celebratory message if the user gets a personal best or the best score so far today.

## [0.1.0] - 2022-09-11
